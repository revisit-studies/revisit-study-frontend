# reVISit study – Interactive, Web-Based User Studies.  

Create your own interactive, web-based data visualization user studies by cloning/forking and editing configuration files and adding stimuli in the `public` folder. 

reVISit introduces reVISit.spec a DSL for specifying study setups (consent forms, training, trials, etc) for interactive web based studies. You describe your experimental setup in reVISit.spec, add your stimuli as images, forms, html pages, or React components, build and deploy – and you're ready to run your study. For tutorials and documentation, see the [reVISit website](https://revisit.dev).
