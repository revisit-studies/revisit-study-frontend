## Information Chunking Survey

In this survey we’d like you to look at a text and add noticeable marks to break it up into information chunks.

To create information chunks in the text, click anywhere in the text and a blue mark will appear ( \ ). These marks will act as the boundaries of each information chunk. Enters and punctuation marks are in the text, but they aren’t considered chunk boundaries unless you add a blue mark because you want them to be a boundary. 
Create a new chunk anytime you think new information is introduced in a text. That can be as specific or general as you want. 

You can remove a mark by clicking on it again.

There will be **4** documents. You have as much time as you want to read and mark a single text before clicking NEXT to move on, but you cannot return to a previous text. 

Start when you’re ready, please try to do it all in one sitting.
